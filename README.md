Hello, I am a low- to mid-poly builder who uses creative thinking and design.





# Discord User is generallycertified, and Roblox User is noniponi12


****About me****
I am a 15-year-old builder on a mission to satisfy you. I specialize in low-poly and mid-poly building.
I have about 1.5 years of experience.
I like building as it is enjoyable and can pay-off both at the same time.
